=== Why separate Model, Repository and Service ?

For maintainability, it's better to cut the application technically.

* `Model`, contains only bean (getter/setter object). Model doesn't contains other code (no business rules, no db request etc). Model can describe integrity constraint.
* `Repository` contains only the db request. It complete object of Model and send it to Service. Repository doesn't know `Service`
* `Service` contains all the business rules. It knows `Model` and `Repository`
* We separate `API` and `gui` to deliver your api or gui separately.


=== Why this technology ?
* Spring boot
* Liquibase
* Wiremock
