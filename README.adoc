# Java Multi-Module Demo

[schema_archi]: readme/JavaMultiModuleDemo_archi.png

Here, you can download a demo java project who contains a demo project “ready to go” who implements :

* Spring boot (hibernate - Spring data - Spring MVC)
* A multi-module project (Service - GUI - API[TODO] )
* An example of CRUD whith validation (javax.validation)
* An example of JUnit test and Integration test
* An example of Liquibase
* Log, ehcache, ff4j, etc [TODO]

## Architecture
![archi][schema_archi] 

### Why separate Model, Repository and Service ?

For maintenability, it's better to cut the application technically.
* `Model`, contains only bean (getter/setter object). Model doesn't contains other code (no business rules, no db request etc). Model can describe integrity constraint.
* `Repository` contains only the db request. It complete object of Model and send it to Service. Repository doesn't know `Service`
* `Service` contains all the business rules. It knows `Model` and `Repository`
* We separate `API`and `gui` to deliver your api or gui separately.


## Why this technology ?
* Spring boot
* Liquibase
* Wiremock

## Testing
### Unit Test

### Integration Test
